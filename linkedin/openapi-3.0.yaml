                occupation: Co-Founder at Freedom Fund Real Estate
                headline: Financial Freedom through Real Estate - LinkedIn Top Voice
                summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy\
                  \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                  \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                  \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                  \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                  \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead to\
                  \ its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
                  \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
                  \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job\
                  \ at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the\
                  \ completion of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month\
                  \ software development boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed\
                  \ at American Express as a Senior Product Manager and then got poached\
                  \ by Amazon in 2017 (because of my LinkedIn profile). My journey\
                  \ has led to a deep sense of perspective, humility, and purpose\
                  \ that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning, and happiness\
                  \ in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for details\

                  summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy\
                    \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                    \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                    \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                    \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                    \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead\
                    \ to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
                    \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
                    \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job\
                    \ at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through\
                    \ the completion of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and\
                    \ a 6-month software development boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation,\
                    \ I landed at American Express as a Senior Product Manager and\
                    \ then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my LinkedIn profile).\
                    \ My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective, humility,\
                    \ and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
                    \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website\

                    \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                    \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                    \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                    \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                    \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead\
                    \ to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
                    \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
                    \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job\
                    \ at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through\
                    \ the completion of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and\
                    \ a 6-month software development boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation,\
                    \ I landed at American Express as a Senior Product Manager and\
                    \ then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my LinkedIn profile).\
                    \ My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective, humility,\
                    \ and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
                    \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website\

                    summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy\
                      \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                      \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                      \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                      \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                      \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead\
                      \ to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was\
                      \ penny-less, had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects\
                      \ (despite applying to 150 companies). My desperate situation\
                      \ led me to take a job at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing\
                      \ myself through the completion of an MBA at the University\
                      \ of Colorado, and a 6-month software development boot camp.\
                      \ \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
                      \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because\
                      \ of my LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense\
                      \ of perspective, humility, and purpose that I draw on to help\
                      \ others find clarity, meaning, and happiness in their careers\
                      \ and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for details on my Mindset\

                  headline: Financial Freedom through Real Estate - LinkedIn Top Voice
                  summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy\
                    \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                    \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                    \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                    \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                    \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead\
                    \ to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
                    \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
                    \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job\
                    \ at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through\
                    \ the completion of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and\
                    \ a 6-month software development boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation,\
                    \ I landed at American Express as a Senior Product Manager and\
                    \ then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my LinkedIn profile).\
                    \ My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective, humility,\
                    \ and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
                    \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website\

                  \ - $162,200 per year. There is a different range applicable to\
                  \ specific work locations, within the San Francisco Bay area and\
                  \ New York City metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this\
                  \ role in those locations is USD $105,300 - $176,900 per year. \
                  \  \n  \nMicrosoft has different base pay ranges for different work\

                  \ competitively and consistently in different geographic markets\
                  \ (see below). The range above reflects the potential base pay across\
                  \ the U.S. for this role (except as noted below); the applicable\
                  \ base pay range will depend on what ultimately is determined to\
                  \ be the candidate\u2019s primary work location. Individual base\
                  \ pay depends on various factors, in addition to primary work location,\
                  \ such as complexity and responsibility of role, job duties/requirements,\
                  \ and relevant experience and skills. Base pay ranges are reviewed\
                  \ and typically updated each year. Offers are made within the base\
                  \ pay range applicable at the time.   \n  \nAt Microsoft certain\
                  \ roles are eligible for additional rewards, including merit increases,\
                  \ annual bonus and stock. These awards are allocated based on individual\
                  \ performance. In addition, certain roles also have the opportunity\
                  \ to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization, depending\
                  \ on the terms of the plan and the employee\u2019s role. Benefits/perks\
                  \ listed here may vary depending on the nature of employment with\
                  \ Microsoft and the country work location. U.S.-based employees\
                  \ have access to healthcare benefits, a 401(k) plan and company\

                  \ two things: discipline (the type of work) and career stage (scope\
                  \ and complexity). The career stage has two parts \u2013 the first\
                  \ identifies whether the role is a manager (M), an individual contributor\
                  \ (IC), an admin-technician-retail (ATR) job, or an intern. The\
                  \ second part identifies the relative seniority of the role \u2013\
                  \ a higher number (or later letter alphabetically in the case of\
                  \ ATR) indicates greater scope and complexity.   \n  \nMicrosoft\

                    summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy\
                      \ at work and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\
                      \nI spent 10 years as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics\
                      \ company that grew to multi-million dollar sales, which I sold\
                      \ in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings into the creation\
                      \ of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors lead\
                      \ to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was\
                      \ penny-less, had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects\
                      \ (despite applying to 150 companies). My desperate situation\
                      \ led me to take a job at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing\
                      \ myself through the completion of an MBA at the University\
                      \ of Colorado, and a 6-month software development boot camp.\
                      \ \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
                      \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because\
                      \ of my LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense\
                      \ of perspective, humility, and purpose that I draw on to help\
                      \ others find clarity, meaning, and happiness in their careers\
                      \ and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for details on my Mindset\

        summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy at work\
          \ and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\nI spent 10 years\
          \ as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics company that grew to multi-million\
          \ dollar sales, which I sold in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings\
          \ into the creation of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors\
          \ lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
          \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying to\
          \ 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job at Best Buy\
          \ for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the completion of an\
          \ MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month software development\
          \ boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
          \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my\
          \ LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective,\
          \ humility, and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
          \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for\

          summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy at work\
            \ and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\nI spent 10 years\
            \ as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics company that grew to multi-million\
            \ dollar sales, which I sold in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings\
            \ into the creation of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors\
            \ lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
            \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
            \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job at Best\
            \ Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the completion\
            \ of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month software development\
            \ boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
            \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my\
            \ LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective,\
            \ humility, and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
            \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for\

          occupation: Co-Founder at Freedom Fund Real Estate
          headline: Financial Freedom through Real Estate - LinkedIn Top Voice
          summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy at work\
            \ and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\nI spent 10 years\
            \ as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics company that grew to multi-million\
            \ dollar sales, which I sold in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings\
            \ into the creation of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors\
            \ lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
            \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
            \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job at Best\
            \ Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the completion\
            \ of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month software development\
            \ boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
            \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my\
            \ LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective,\
            \ humility, and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
            \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for\
            \ details on my Mindset Reset Podcast, Public Speaking, Consulting, or\

            \nFAQ's\n\nQ: Can you speak at my Company, University, event or podcast?\n\
            A: I'd love to! I've shared my message on the future of employment, breaking\
            \ into big tech, and my personal story of reinventing myself and discovering\
            \ my sense of purpose (and how you can too!).\n\n\u2611\uFE0F  YouTube\

          summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy at work\
            \ and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\nI spent 10 years\
            \ as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics company that grew to multi-million\
            \ dollar sales, which I sold in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings\
            \ into the creation of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors\
            \ lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
            \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
            \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job at Best\
            \ Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the completion\
            \ of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month software development\
            \ boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
            \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my\
            \ LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective,\
            \ humility, and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
            \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for\

          \ work. To learn more about pay equity and our other commitments to increase\
          \ representation and strengthen our culture of inclusion, check out our\
          \ annual Diversity & Inclusion Report. ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/annual-report\
          \ )   \n  \nUnderstanding roles at Microsoft   \n  \nThe top of this page\
          \ displays the role for which the base pay ranges apply \u2013 Integrated\
          \ Marketing IC3. The way we define roles includes two things: discipline\
          \ (the type of work) and career stage (scope and complexity). The career\
          \ stage has two parts \u2013 the first identifies whether the role is a\
          \ manager (M), an individual contributor (IC), an admin-technician-retail\
          \ (ATR) job, or an intern. The second part identifies the relative seniority\
          \ of the role \u2013 a higher number (or later letter alphabetically in\
          \ the case of ATR) indicates greater scope and complexity.   \n  \nMicrosoft\
          \ is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive\
          \ consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, color, family\
          \ or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information,\
          \ marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental\
          \ disability, political affiliation, protected veteran status, race, religion,\
          \ sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic\
          \ protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. We also consider\
          \ qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with\
          \ legal requirements. If you need assistance and/or a reasonable accommodation\
          \ due to a disability during the application or the recruiting process,\
          \ please send a request via the Accommodation request form.   \n  \nThe\
          \ salary for this role in the state of Colorado is between $108,200 and\
          \ $162,200.   \n  \nAt Microsoft, certain roles are eligible for additional\
          \ rewards, including annual bonus and stock. These awards are allocated\
          \ based on individual performance. In addition, certain roles also have\
          \ the opportunity to earn sales incentives based on revenue or utilization,\
          \ depending on the terms of the plan and the employee\u2019s role. Benefits/perks\
          \ listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with\
          \ Microsoft and the country where you work. \n"

          headline: Financial Freedom through Real Estate - LinkedIn Top Voice
          summary: "Most people go through life lost, disengaged, and unhappy at work\
            \ and in their lives - I'm on a mission to solve that.\n\nI spent 10 years\
            \ as the founder of Axxis Audio, an electronics company that grew to multi-million\
            \ dollar sales, which I sold in 2012. At that time, I funneled my earnings\
            \ into the creation of an Internet of Things company, but numerous factors\
            \ lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years. \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less,\
            \ had a baby on the way, and had zero job prospects (despite applying\
            \ to 150 companies). My desperate situation led me to take a job at Best\
            \ Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing myself through the completion\
            \ of an MBA at the University of Colorado, and a 6-month software development\
            \ boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I landed at American Express as a Senior\
            \ Product Manager and then got poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my\
            \ LinkedIn profile). My journey has led to a deep sense of perspective,\
            \ humility, and purpose that I draw on to help others find clarity, meaning,\
            \ and happiness in their careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for\
